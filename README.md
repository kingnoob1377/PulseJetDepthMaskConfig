# PulseJetDepthMaskConfig


Simple DepthMask config for PulseJet by Watermel00n.

This mod supports the one and only part in Pulse Jet, which is J-X2 "Backfire" Pulse Jet Engine.

This is achieved by replacing the .mu (model) of the parts with one supplied in this add-on and adding [ModuleDepthMask] to the part. Nothing else is affected.
